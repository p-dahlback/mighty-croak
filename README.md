============

A simple library for LibGDX games that I use for Ludum Dare stuffs.

This library was originally made as a code base for the LD30 48 hour competition in August 2014.
Most of it was written before the competition to clear up time that I would otherwise spend on doing 
the same base classes that I do for every LibGDX game.

Feel free to look around! But I make no guarantees about the quality of the code.
